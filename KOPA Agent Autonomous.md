# 🏆 KOPA Agent  
### Autonomous Escrow & Payments for Informal Trade

> **KOPA Agent replaces middlemen with AI agents that hold, verify, and release payments automatically using x402 escrow — settling African trade in milliseconds instead of weeks.**

---

## 🌍 Problem

Across Africa, most economic activity happens in **informal trade**:
- Farmers selling crops
- Small merchants sourcing goods
- Freelancers delivering work
- Community savings groups (Chamas)

The real problem is **not wallets**.  
It is **trust**.

Today:
- Buyers don’t trust sellers → delayed payments
- Sellers don’t trust buyers → risky upfront delivery
- Middlemen charge 10–30% to “guarantee” trust
- Banks and mobile money are slow, manual, and irreversible

**Money moves slower than goods.**

---

## 💡 Solution

**KOPA Agent is an autonomous AI escrow agent** that enforces trust using **x402 conditional payments**.

Instead of:
- *“Pay now and hope”*  
- *“Deliver first and pray”*

KOPA Agent:
1. Locks funds securely
2. Verifies real-world conditions
3. Releases payments instantly when conditions are met

No middlemen.  
No disputes.  
No waiting.

## 🤖 What Is KOPA Agent?

KOPA Agent is a **machine-to-machine (M2M) economic agent** that:
- Creates x402 escrow holds
- Verifies delivery or task completion
- Executes instant settlement on Cronos

It acts as a **neutral, autonomous referee** for informal trade.

## 🔑 Core Use Case (Hackathon Focus)

### 🧑‍🌾 Farmer → Buyer Agricultural Trade

This project intentionally focuses on **one clear economic loop**.

### Flow

#### 1️⃣ Escrow Creation
- Buyer agrees to purchase crops (e.g. $200)
- KOPA Agent creates an **x402 payment hold**
- Funds are locked, not transferred

#### 2️⃣ Delivery Verification
- Farmer ships goods
- Proof is submitted (QR scan, receipt, confirmation)
- AI Verification Agent validates the condition

#### 3️⃣ Instant Settlement
- Conditions satisfied
- x402 Facilitator releases funds
- Farmer receives payment in **~200ms**

💥 Faster than banks. Safer than cash.

## 🔐 Why x402 Is Critical

KOPA Agent uses x402 for **true programmable payments**, not simple transfers.

x402 enables:
- Conditional escrow
- Hold-and-release logic
- Multi-party settlement

> **Without x402, KOPA Agent cannot exist.**

This demonstrates the real power of agentic finance.
